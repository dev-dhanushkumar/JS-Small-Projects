        <p>Server-rendering a page that uses only synchronous data is pretty simple: You just walk down the component tree, rendering each element to an HTML string. But this is a pretty big caveat: it does not answer the question of what we should do with pages that includes asynchronous data, i.e., the sort of stuff that would be rendered under a node on the client.</p>
        <p>When a page loads async data that it needs to render, what should we do? Should we wait for all the async data to load, and then render everything at once? (Let’s call this “async” rendering) Should we go all the way in the opposite direction, just sending the HTML we have immediately down to the client and letting the client load the resources and fill them in? (Let’s call this “synchronous” rendering) Or is there some middle-ground solution that somehow beats them both? (Hint: There is.)</p>
